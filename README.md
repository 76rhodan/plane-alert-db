# plane-alert-db
This project contains several lists of 'interesting' aircraft, formatted as a CSV files. These files are designed to work with the excellent https://github.com/kx1t/docker-planefence and take the form 

- ICAO,Ident,Operator,Type,CMPG,$Tag,Category

e.g 406C1B,G-CNWL,Cornwall Air Ambulance,Bell MD-900 Explorer,Civ,Air Ambo,M\*A\*S\*H 

Where $Tag will be appended to any tweet generated by PlaneAlert, in the eample above the tag would be 'Air Ambo'

# Description of Categories	   

Think of categories like groups, with similar or related aircraft listed together. This allows you to easily select a subset of the list for your own use. The category names (and tags) come from my rather idiosyncratic sense of humour. If you have better suggestions I'm all ears.

- Aerobatic Teams
- Battle of Britiain Memorial Flight	
- Business	
- Community -	Suggested by you. Aircraft start here and move other other categories
- Dictator Alert	
- M\*A\*S\*H -	Air Ambulance and Medical Flights
- Military Contractors	
- Nuclear	- Nuclear Emergency Support Team etc
- Royal Aircraft - Aircraft used or owned by the UK Royal Family
- Spotted -	Aircraft spotted by my ADSB station. Aircraft start here and move other other categories
- UK National Police Air Service
